# README

Hello there!

Welcome to **Digital Forensics**. Throughout this course, we will be learning how to perform investigations and Forensic Analysis of Windows Machines and some parts of Linux machines as well. This document outlines the prerequisites and initial instructions for the course. Please read through this document to avoid any issues during the labs and exercises.

## System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems
- **Windows (Preferred):** A native Windows installation is ideal for this course. The reason for this is because we have a Linux Machine that has to be loaded as a VM, and Windows provides good Virtualisation support
- **Linux**: This is also a supported Operating System as we can Virtualize Windows in this as well, but not really sure how well Autopsy runs on a Virtual Machine

**A Linux Virtual Machine that is specially curated for this course will be shared**

### Unsupported Operating Systems
- **Mac:** I don't know what else you were expecting here. Mac systems have ARM chips and the tools that are needed for Forensic Investigation and Virtualisation require x86 architecture. If you do have a Mac machine, then it is preferred to do all of the labs at the ISFCR center.

## Important Notes

1. **Compatibility:** Using an unsupported system may lead to issues during the course. We are not responsible for any problems or any issues faced during labs if you guys choose to use unsupported hardware
2. **READ THE INSTRUCTIONS:** Make sure you read all of the instructions properly before starting off with anything, because there are chances that not following the instruction properly can lead to crashing your system.
